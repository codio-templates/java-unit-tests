* `secretIdentity` - String with the true name of the hero, e.g. `"Peter Parker"`
* `powers` - An array of strings with each element representing a power, e.g.
```java
["superhuman strength", "superhuman speed", "superhuman reflexes", "superhuman durability", "healing factor", "spider-sense alert", "heightened senses", "wallcrawling"]
```
