## Open the File
You have to tell Processing the file you want to open. In the Processing window, click `File` then `Open...`. On the left towards the bottom of the list, click `workspace`. Double click on `code`, double click on `advanced`, and double click on `FlappyBird`. Finally, open the `FlappyBird.pde` file. This should open five different files.
