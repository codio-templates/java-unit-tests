## Exercise 5

Define the class `BigCat` which will help record information on the animals in the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard). Since all animals are in the same genus, the object should have the **class attribute** `genus` with the value `panthera`. The constructor should accept the following parameters (in this order): 

* `species`- String with the species of the animal, e.g. `"tigris"`
* `commonName` - String with the common name of the animal, e.g. `"tiger"`
* `habitat` - Array of strings with location of the animal, e.g. `{"asia"}`
