## Lab Challenge

Create the variable `dog1`, and instantiate an object of the `Dog` class. This dog's name is `Marceline` and she is a `German Shepherd`. Create the variable `dog2` and make a **deep copy** of `dog1`. `dog2` should be named `Cajun` and have the breed `Belgian Malinois`. Test your code by printing the `name` and `breed` of each dog to make sure they fulfill the requirements above.
