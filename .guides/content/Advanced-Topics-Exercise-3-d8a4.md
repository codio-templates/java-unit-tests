## Exercise 3

Create the `Dog` class with the string attributes for `name` and `breed`. These attributes need to have getter methods. Then create an ArrayList of five dogs according to the following table:

|Dog|Name     |Breed           |
|---|---------|----------------|
|1  |Marceline|German Shepherd |
|2  |Cajun    |Belgian Malinois|
|3  |Daisy    |Border Collie   |
|4  |Rocky    |Golden Retriever|
|5  |Bella    |Irish Setter    |

Verify that the name and breed of the dogs in the list match the order of the table.
